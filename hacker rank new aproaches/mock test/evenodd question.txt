even odd question of mock test

You are given a positive integer N.
Consider the following algorithm:

If N is even, N = N/2 (rounded down to nearest integer i.e 5/2=2 7/2= 3)
If N is odd , N = 3N+1 (3 times N plus 1)
The algorithm never stops until N becomes 1.
Find out in how many steps, N reduces down to 1.

For example:
if N=3
3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
N reduces down to 1 in 7 steps
