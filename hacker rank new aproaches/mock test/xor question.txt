xor question in mocktest
You are given an array A of size n i.e A1 , A2 , A3 ... An. You are also given Q queries.
For each query , You are given 2 integers L , R (1<=L<=R<=n).
Find the xor sum of all values in range [ L , R ].
In other words, find A[L] ^ A[L+1] ^ A[L+2] ^ ... A[R] for each query.

where '^' stands for XOR (a ^ b = a xor b)

Input Format

The first input line has two integers n (size of the array) and Q (number of queries).
The second line has n integers A1 , A2 , A2 ... An the array values.
Finally, there are Q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers L and R.
Constraints

1 <= n , q <= 2 x 105
1 <= Ai <= 109
1 <= L,R <= n
Output Format

Print q integers, one integer per line
