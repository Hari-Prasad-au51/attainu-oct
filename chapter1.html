  a:meta tag: <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp>meta tag</a>       meta attributes:(imp)meta-> charset="UTF-8"(The "charset" attribute in HTML is like a secret code that tells the web browser how to read and display the text in a webpage.
    Different websites can use different codes, and the "charset" attribute makes sure the right code is used so that the text appears correctly on the page. 
    It's like having the right key to unlock and read a secret message.)
    
    UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used to represent the characters and symbols used in the world's writing systems.
    It stands for "Unicode Transformation Format in 8-bit format".

UTF-8 is one of the most widely used character encodings, and is particularly well-suited for use on the Internet, as it can handle any character in the Unicode standard.
    This includes letters and symbols from a variety of writing systems, as well as a wide range of special characters and emoji.

In UTF-8, each character is represented by a unique number, or code point. This code point is then encoded into one or more bytes, depending on the specific character.
    This allows the representation of a wide range of characters using a consistent encoding, making it well-suited for use in internationalized text.
