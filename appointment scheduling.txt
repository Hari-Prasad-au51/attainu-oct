                                                               Appointment Scheduling

Introduction:  I got this idea from a friend who is a barber. I noticed that many customers visit the barber shop at the same time, which makes it difficult for the barber to provide haircuts to all of them. As a result, he loses customers, and the customers feel that it's a waste of time and move to other shops. After observing this, I felt that there should be an app that is useful to both the customer and the barber, and that's what my app does. With the app, the customer can book an appointment, see available time slots or when the flow is low, and the barber can better manage their schedule. When I discussed this idea with my project partner, he also faced similar issues in the past, so we decided to proceed with the project. 


Interfaces: Our project includes two interfaces: one for the user and the other for the barber (admin). In the user interface, users have access to the following features:
1.	Home page: This is the landing page of the app, where users can find information about the company and its services.
2.	Services: This section provides information about the different services that the company offers.
3.	Achievements: This section showcases the company's achievements.
4.	Feedback: This section allows users to provide feedback on their experience with the company, which can help the company improve its services.
5.	Appointments: This section allows users to book appointments with the company, including selecting a preferred barber and time slot.
6.	Logout: This feature allows users to log out of the app when they're finished using it.
Overall, the user interface is designed to be user-friendly and provide all the necessary information and features that users need to interact with the company.

In the admin panel, the barber (admin) has access to the following features:
1.	Home page: This is the landing page of the admin panel, where the barber can view information about the app and its usage.
2.	Add achievements: This feature allows the barber to add new achievements to the app.
3.	Add services: This feature allows the barber to add new services to the app, including descriptions.
4.	Delete appointments: This feature allows the barber to delete appointments that have been made by users, such as if a user cancels their appointment.
5.	View feedbacks: This feature allows the barber to view feedback provided by users, which can help the barber improve their services.
6.	Logout: This feature allows the barber to log out of the admin panel when they're finished using it.
Overall, the admin panel is designed to provide the barber with the necessary tools to manage their services, including adding new services and achievements, managing appointments, and viewing user feedback.


Features and functionality: In the appointment booking page, when a user successfully books an appointment, their appointment details are stored in the database. The user can then view their appointments in the "My Appointments" section of the app, where all of their booked appointments are displayed.
Furthermore, to prevent users from booking duplicate time slots, a pop-up message will appear if the user tries to select a time slot that is already booked. This message will notify the user that the selected time slot is already taken on the particular date they have selected, which will help to avoid duplicate bookings.
By implementing these features, the app aims to provide a seamless and efficient booking experience for users while also preventing any scheduling conflicts for the barber.


Design and user interface: By making my app dynamic, I aim to ensure that every piece of data from the user is stored in the database. This approach can help to create an efficient and effective user experience, as storing user data in a database allows for easy access and retrieval of user information.
Moreover, having a dynamic app that stores user data in a database enables real-time updates and changes to the app's functionality and features. This ensures that the app can evolve and adapt to changing user needs and preferences, improving the overall user experience.
Overall, the strategy of making my app dynamic and storing user data in a database is an effective way to enhance the app's user interface and streamline the user experience.


Security: Ensuring the security of sensitive user data is a top priority in our app. To achieve this, we take several measures, including securing user passwords in token format to make it difficult for hackers to gain access. Additionally, we implement user authentication in our app, which means that users cannot access the app without proper authentication.
By implementing user authentication, we can control access to sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. This provides an added layer of security to the app, which is crucial in protecting user privacy and data.
Furthermore, we ensure that all sensitive data stored in the app's database is encrypted to prevent any unauthorized access or data breaches. This is achieved by using industry-standard encryption protocols that ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.
Overall, our app's approach to data security involves multiple layers of protection to ensure that sensitive user data remains secure and confidential at all times.


Technology : In our project, we use MongoDB as our database to store data, with Node.js as the language to access the database. We use JavaScript as our scripting language, with Express as our backend language. Additionally, we use EJS as our template engine to access the backend directly, which allows for efficient rendering of dynamic data on the front-end.
To enhance the user interface, we use Bootstrap for styling, which allows the app to be easily accessible on mobile devices. We also use jQuery calendar to allow users to select dates when booking appointments.
Throughout the development of our project, we make use of various packages and middlewares to improve its functionality and security. These include security-focused middlewares like jwt, which protects against common web application security threats, as well as packages like bcrypt to ensure that user passwords are properly hashed and stored securely.
Overall, our project makes use of a range of technologies and tools to create an efficient, secure, and user-friendly app that meets the needs of both users and barbers.
